" The “secular stagnation” thesis is having a bad year. Readers will recall that this idea, popularized by former Obama White House economist Larry Summers, held that America is fated to endure slow economic growth.

"BRUSSELS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Belgium’s D‘Ieteren wants 35-40 percent of its vehicle sales to be electric vehicles by 2025, the head of its car sales division has told Belgian business daily L‘Echo.\nD‘Ieteren, which sells cars and parts of Volkswagen brands including Skoda, Audi and Lamborghini in Belgium, has a more ambitious target than the German group which wants electrified vehicles to be a quarter of deliveries by 2025.\n“In Belgium, particularly in Flanders and Brussels, the (short) driving distances are very suitable for electric,” D‘Ieteren Auto chief Denis Gorteman told L‘Echo, adding that the high percentage of people living in houses, rather than apartments, meant it was easier for them to charge vehicles.\nGorteman said that to achieve the target Belgium needed to invest in the sector and have policies that encouraged electric vehicle use, although he said the sector was not looking for subsidies.\nVolkswagen approved in November a 34 billion euro ($40.6 billion) spending plan to accelerate its efforts to become a global leader in electric cars.\nAs well as selling cars, D‘Ieteren also has a division repairing and replacing windshields and owns notebook maker Moleskine.

"CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Tamil Nadu state must compensate the parents of a girl who was electrocuted to death in a textile mill where they worked as bonded laborers, India’s human rights panel has ordered.\nThursday’s order highlights the plight of millions of people working as virtual slaves to repay debts throughout India, including Tamil Nadu where the textile industry is concentrated, campaigners said.\n“Many are trapped in bondage in spinning mills in the region,” said Thangavel Maran of the charity Vizhuthugal (Roots), which took the case to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).\n“Nobody knows them and it is only when an incident like this happens that the cases come out,” he said. “It is the industry’s dirty secret.”\nEmployers often hold children to ensure that their parents return when they travel home for weddings or funerals.\nKarunaiyammal and Balasubramani Bathran said they were forced to leave their six-year-old daughter, Nalini, at the factory while they went home for a day trip in 2014.\n“We left early in the morning and by the time we came back in the evening, she had died,” said Balasubramani.\n“They said she had accidentally touched a live wire,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. “No other explanation was given and no help was offered.”\nIndia banned bonded labor in 1976 but it remains widespread across brick kilns, rice mills and other industries.\nMany bonded laborers are essentially enslaved, as they work to pay off heavy debts that are compounded by interest and shady accounting practices. Activists say they often end up paying 10 times the amount borrowed.\nEmployers commonly restrict the freedom of movement of bonded laborers, forcing them to live within the premises of their work site.\nAt the time of their child’s death, the Bathrans had been working for nearly two years to pay off a loan of 60,000 Indian rupees ($942).\nThe NHRC has instructed the Tamil Nadu government to recognize that the couple were in bondage and to compensate them according to the law.\nSome 500,000 manual laborers in 11 industries in Tamil Nadu, including the multi billion dollar textile industry, are trapped in debt bondage, according to the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization.\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December as factories cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed on Tuesday.\nA production line is seen inside a factory of Saic GM Wuling, in Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, June 19, 2016. REUTERS/Norihiko Shirouzu/Files The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world’s second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.\nThe Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists’ expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.\nThe 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.\nAnalysts have expected some softening in China’s manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world’s second-largest economy.\nThat view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace.\nBut Caixin’s findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.\nTotal new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.\nThe Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.\nWhile the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China’s exporters in the next few months.\nPRICE PRESSURES However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.\nCompanies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises.\nChina’s vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fuelled demand and prices for building materials.\nBut government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade.\nBeijing’s war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.\nSome steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share.\nDespite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided.\n“Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,” Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.\n”However, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.”\nAnalysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.\nSources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilising build-up of debt.\nReporting by Lusha Zhang and Elias Glenn; Editing by Kim Coghill\n","[""According to a private industry survey, China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly experienced growth in December that rose to a four-month high, spurred by expanded production to satisfy growing orders.

"South Korean hospital fire kills 19 people, around 50 injured - fire official, media',
   'text': 'January 26, 2018 / 1:29 AM / Updated 6 hours ago South Korean hospital blaze kills at least 37, fleeing patients brave flames Christine Kim 6 Min Read \nMIRYANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Once famous for an award-winning film of the same name, the South Korean city of Miryang became a scene of horror on Friday as flames and toxic smoke swept through a hospital, killing at least 37 people and injuring more than 140. \nSouth Korea’s deadliest fire in almost a decade followed one last month that killed 29 people, reviving concern over safety standards, as the hospital director said current law did not require the building to have a sprinkler system. \n“So many lives were sacrificed and the people of our city, as well as those throughout the country, have fallen into deep grief,” the city’s mayor, Park Il-ho, told reporters, appearing visibly distressed. \nMany patients “walked though fire and smoke” to escape from the Sejong Hospital as the main exit was on the first floor, which was ablaze, a city official told Reuters. \nThose on upper floors used ladders and plastic escape slides to flee, while firefighters carried some who could not walk. \n“I saw the elderly patients scrambling out through the windows and had to help,” said Woo Young-min, 25, as he stood in his pyjamas outside the hospital. \nThe presidential Blue House initially said the number of dead was at least 41, but deferred to a toll of 37 from the fire chief of Miryang, which is about 270 km (170 miles) southeast of Seoul, the capital, and home to about 108,000 people. \nFire officials posted a list of at least 26 victims outside the hospital, their ages ranging from 34 to 96 years, with at least a score over 70. \nFamilies crowded round a handwritten list of names and hospital rooms that officials had scrawled on a wall at a nearby funeral home. \nThe fire broke out around 7.30 a.m. (2230 GMT) at the rear of the emergency room on the hospital’s first floor, fire official Choi Man-woo told a televised news briefing. \nThe street outside the hospital featured in the 2007 South Korean drama “Miryang,” or “Secret Sunshine,” which garnered awards at Cannes and other film festivals. \nBut on Friday, witnesses described scenes of chaos in the sub-freezing temperatures, as nearby residents rushed to take portable hotpacks to shivering victims. \nWoo said he was walking home after working a graveyard shift when he saw the fire and patients trying to escape the blaze. \n“The firefighters were shouting at us not to go inside the building, so I stayed and helped others bring the patients down the slides.” \nTelevision broadcast images of black smoke billowing from the windows and entrance of the hospital as flames flickered. \nAt least 177 patients - most of them elderly - were at the hospital and an adjacent nursing home when the fire broke out, hospital director Song Byeong-cheol told reporters. \nSong said three of the nine hospital staff on duty at the time died, including at least one doctor, a nurse, and a nurse’s aide, all killed on the second floor. A firefighter walks out of a burnt hospital in Miryang, South Korea, January 26, 2018. Kim Dong-min/Yonhap via REUTERS \nMost of those who died were on the first and second floors, said Choi, but added that there were no deaths from burns. \nSeven people were critically injured, while 126 had less serious wounds, officials told a Friday evening briefing. \nThe injured were treated at 14 regional hospitals. \nBy Friday afternoon, police had cordoned off the burnt-out hospital, as forensic investigators combed the smoke-blackened building. Charred debris and shattered glass littered the ground outside. NO SPRINKLER SYSTEM \nAsia’s fourth-largest economy, with one of the world’s fastest ageing populations, South Korea has faced criticism in recent years over inadequate safety standards. Slideshow (5 Images) \nSong said the six-storey hospital did not have a sprinkler system and was not large enough to require one under the law. \nThe nursing home annexe, where no patients died, is covered by a new law, however, and Song said the hospital had planned to begin installing a sprinkler system there next week. \nHealth Minister Park Neung-hoo said the government would consider changing the law. \nInterior ministry guidelines published in December 2016 suggest sprinklers for all buildings of six or more storeys. \nOfficials said they were still investigating the cause of the fire, but were looking at a possible short circuit in the emergency room’s heating and cooling system. \n“According to an initial eyewitness, fire broke out where there are two air-conditioning and heating devices in the emergency room,” Song said. \n“Others said an electric spark occurred on the ceiling of the emergency room and then fire spread quickly.” \nThe hospital had regular safety inspections and was built to government standards, with fire exits and extinguishers, many of which were used during the fire, he added. \nPresident Moon Jae-in held an emergency meeting with top aides and urged “all necessary measures” to help survivors. \nInterior Minister Kim Boo-kyum, who visited Miryang to apologise for the fire, promised government help for victims, Yonhap news agency said. \nIn December, 29 people were killed in a blaze at an eight-storey fitness centre in Jecheon City, most of them women trapped in a sauna by toxic fumes. The event fed anger over reports of shoddy construction, among other shortcomings. \nIn 2014, a fire at a rural hospital killed 21 people, while a 2008 warehouse fire outside Seoul killed 40.

That means only the designated owner will be able to create reminders, send text messages, and get calendar notifications from the built-in Siri, according to online news and entertainment site. \nAdditionally, the report said Siri will only call out notifications, including text messages and calendar appointments, when that owner is on the same network as the HomePod. When he or she is away from the network, Siri will not report that someone texted. \nApple unveiled its HomePod last year and pitched it first and foremost as a smart speaker that would deliver far better sound than some of its competitors, including the Amazon Echo and Google Home. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nHowever, the HomePod is also powered by Apple’s virtual personal assistant Siri, allowing users to control smart home gadgets like lights and thermostats. According to Refinery29, Siri will also be able to create and alert users to reminders and read aloud text messages—features that could help folks stay abreast of what’s happening without ever needing to pick up their iPhones. \nWhile HomePod owners will likely find value in Siri not calling out the content of text messages when they’re not home for privacy’s sake, it’s unclear how HomePod would work in a family setting. For instance, some families might have multiple iCloud accounts and in some settings, they might want text messages and calendar information from one iCloud account shared and in other settings, have other iCloud information beaming through the house. \nUltimately, the report sheds light on the sheer number of questions industry watchers have about HomePod and how it will work in a real-world setting. And we likely won’t have answers to all of those questions until the smart speaker hits store shelves on February 9. \nApple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on HomePod’s privacy features. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT',","[""Apple's new HomePod smart speaker will prioritize privacy by connecting only to the iCloud account of the person who first configures it. This implies that only the identified owner can use the integrated Siri to create reminders, send SMS messages, and get calendar notifications. Furthermore, Siri will only disclose notifications if the owner is connected to the same network as the HomePod. This method ensures that personal information is only available to the proper owner, hence improving privacy and security. The HomePod will be available on February 9. Apple has yet to respond to these privacy features.""]"," According to a report by Refinery29, Apple's upcoming smart speaker HomePod will have features designed to protect users' privacy.

"Shares of Card Factory plunge on lower profit forecast',
   'text': 'Jan 11 (Reuters) - Shares of British greeting cards retailer Card Factory were on track for their worst single day since listing after predicting lower core earnings for 2017 on tighter margins.\nThe retailer, which went public in 2014, said it expects underlying EBITDA for the year ended Dec. 31 to come in between 93 million pounds-95 million pounds ($128.10-$125.40 million). The range is lower than 98.5 million pounds reported last year.\nShares of the company were down 21 percent at 222.8 pence at 0846 GMT, making them the top drag on the FTSE Mid Cap index.\nThe retailer, which sells most of its products for under a pound, said like-for-like sales in the Christmas trading period were driven by lower margin non-card categories, such as gifts and dressings.\nThe company said profit would be hurt by previously flagged pressure from a weaker pound, as about half of the company’s annual costs of its goods come from products sourced in U.S. dollars, and higher costs for wages.\nBritain’s finance minister in 2016 raised the minimum wage to 7.50 pounds from 7.20 pounds.\nThe company said it expects the combined impact of foreign exchange and wage inflation to result in 7 million to 8 million pounds of additional costs in 2019\n“...whilst we have plans to mitigate this impact as far as possible, we recognise that against this backdrop, any EBITDA growth for the year is likely to be limited,” its Chief Executive Karen Hubbard said on Thursday.
